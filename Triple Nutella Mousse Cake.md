## Brownie Base

### Ingredients
- 226g Nutella
- 113 grams unsalted butter, cut into pieces
- 150 grams granulated sugar (directions mention using BROWN sugar)
- 3 large eggs, room temperature
- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract (original uses 1 tablespoon)
- 125 grams plain white flour
- 3 tablespoons Dutch-process cocoa powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt

### Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 180ÂºC. 
1. Line the bottom a 9-inch springform pan with aluminum foil and spray the foil lightly with nonstick spray. Line the sides of the pan with parchment paper.
1. Add the Nutella and butter to a medium saucepan. Warm over medium-low heat, stirring constantly until Nutella is melty and smooth. Whisk in the sugar. Set aside to cool slightly.
1. Once cooled, whisk in the eggs and vanilla until combined. 
1. Sift the flour, cocoa powder, and salt into the Nutella mixture and fold together with a rubber spatula just until combined. 
1. Spread the batter evenly into the bottom of the prepared pan. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with only a few moist crumbs. 
1. Leave the brownie in the pan and set it wire rack to cool completely. Or pop it in the refrigerator for 15-20 minutes.

### Notes
You can underbake the brownie base slightly if you want a fudgy texture.

## Nutella Mousse

### Ingredients
- 2 and 1/4 teaspoons plain gelatin powder, 1 packet
- 4 tablespoons cold water
- 226 grams Nutella
- 360 ml heavy cream, divided (120ml and 240ml)
- 1/8 teaspoons salt

### Directions
1. In a small bowl, sprinkle the gelatin over water, let stand for 5 minutes.
1. Bring the Nutella and 120ml of the cream to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium-high heat, whisking until the Nutella has fully melted. Remove from heat.
1. Add the salt and softened gelatin; whisk until gelatin is fully dissolved. Transfer to a large bowl and cool to room temperature, stirring occasionally. The mixture will thicken slightly.
    - **Note**: During the cooling process, it is very important that you stir the Nutella mixture frequently. If you fail to do this you may end up with tiny little gelatin balls throughout the mousse.
1. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whip the remaining 240ml cream at medium speed until it begins to thicken, about 30 seconds. Increase the speed to high and whip until soft peaks form, about 30 to 60 seconds.
1. Use a whisk to mix in 1/3 of the whipped cream into the Nutella mixture. Use a rubber spatula to fold in the remaining whipped cream until no streaks appear.
1. Spoon the mousse into the pan over the brownie layer. Smooth the top with an offset spatula. Place the cake in the refrigerator and chill until set, about 2 hours.

## Nutella Ganache

### Ingredients
- 300 grams Nutella
- 120 milliliters heavy cream

### Directions
1. Warm the Nutella and cream in a small saucepan over medium-low heat, whisking until the Nutella has fully melted. Set aside to cool for 10 minutes, stir it occasionally.
    - **Note**: It's important to let the ganache cool before topping the mousse with it. If you pour warm ganache over the cold mousse, you'll get condensation which will seep from the crack where they meet. 
1. Pour the glaze over the top of the mousse layer and use an offset spatula to smooth it over. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour or until the glaze has set.
1. Carefully remove the sides of the pan and dispose of the parchment paper. Serve the cake with whipped cream or fresh berries.

# Make ahead tip
1. The cake will keep for up to 3 days stored in the refrigerator.
1. The cake can be frozen for up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight before serving.
